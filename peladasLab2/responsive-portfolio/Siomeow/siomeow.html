            <p>This game was developed by <strong><span class="highlighted-name">Sigbin Overlords</span></strong> as part of a Data Communications and Networking course.
                Embracing our love for cats, we feature feline adventurers as the main characters, each embodying agility, curiosity, 
                and charm. This blend of player-versus-player dynamics with cat personas creates a unique game that’s both thrilling and 
                whimsically engaging.</p>

            <div class="game-text">
                <p>In a world where cats of all types—mages, swordsmen, knights, and rogues—are captured and forced into
                     a brutal arena, only the deadliest can claim victory. These skilled cats must rely on their unique 
                     abilities and ruthless instincts to eliminate every rival standing in their way. Each battle is a 
                     savage fight for dominance, and only the fiercest feline will emerge victorious, while the rest are
                      doomed to a grim fate: being turned into siomeow.

                    Siomeow Legends is a top-down, free-for-all deathmatch game where survival isn’t enough—players must 
                    dominate the battlefield by defeating as many opponents as possible to secure the top spot. Set in 
                    randomized arenas filled with hidden dangers and cunning traps, players control fierce feline champions, 
                    fighting tooth and claw to rack up kills and climb the leaderboard.</p>
