        <h2>About the Creators</h2>
        <div class="about-creators-content">
            <p>This game was developed by <strong><span class="highlighted-name">AGIPP IT Solutions</span></strong> as part of a software engineering project. 
                The goal was to create an immersive experience that combines adventure and puzzle-solving 
                elements to engage players while shedding light on the realities of life during the Martial 
                Law era. By drawing from real stories and experiences, the game aims to educate players about 
                this historical period and help counter the spread of misinformation surrounding what is often 
                referred to as the "Golden Era."</p>

            <div class="game-text">
                <p>"Beyond the Mirage" invites players to uncover the hidden truths of the Marcos era. A mirage, an optical illusion, symbolizes how the “Golden Era” may appear one way but hides deeper complexities and distorted realities. The game encourages players to explore these untold stories and challenge misconceptions.

                    This desktop-based Historical Top-Down RPG allows players to navigate a historical setting, shape the narrative, and interact with in-game characters, making choices that influence the course of the story.</p>
